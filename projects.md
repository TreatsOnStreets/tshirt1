__Q: How did you get into art?__
A: Well, my grandpa was an artist. When I was little I would go to his house and go down to his studio and just look at everything. Looking back at it now you can really see his art in mine because of the importance of line in both of our work. When I was younger I would copy his signature onto the bottom of my pieces that I would make to look like his. But I didn’t start taking art seriously until sophomore/junior year when I took art classes at Southwest.

__Q: What does art mean to you?__
A: To me, art is almost more about the process than the finished piece. Because I work with paper cut the process is very methodical and almost therapeutic. It takes a long time where in order to get a piece done I have to completely submerge myself into art and that state of mind.

__Q: What are your plans for the future as an artist?__
A: I plan to study art in college, hopefully in Chicago. I guess we will have to wait and see where that takes me.

__Q: What's the significance of this piece and why did you choose it?__
A: This one doesn’t have a name and I like to call it Untitled #2. It was one of the first pieces where I expanded off of my paper cut. I made a stencil by making a paper cut and used it to make a monoprint. I thought it showed my style as an artist the most and it’s one of the pieces i’m most proud of.
